## Introduction
 This addendum describes the requirements for acceptance of any deliverables which feature media. Deliverables which do not meet these requirements will not be accepted and invoices submitted for those deliverables will not be paid until these requirements have been met in their entirety. Vendor understands that this addendum is part of the overall contract of services purchased and that any changes required to deliverables so that they conform to these requirements will not incur any extra charges beyond that which is defined in [Reference to purchase price elsewhere in contract]
 
This addendum is written in conformance with RFC 2119, which defines keywords used to indicate conformance. This addendum follows the "Must/Shall", "Must Not/ Shall Not", "Should/ May", and "Should Not" convention of defining requirements at the following levels:
* "Must" and "Shall" indicate requirements that deliverables are required to meet in order to be accepted.
* "Must not" and "Shall not" indicate characteristics that will be deemed to have violated these requirements and the deliverable will be rejected by Customer
* "Should" and "May" indicate optional characteristics and hints for a higher quality deliverable. These characteristics are not alternatives to Customer's requirements but simply suggestions.
* "Should Not" indicates characteristics that will erode quality of the Deliverable and avoiding such characteristics is advisable. 


## Applicability
This addendum applies to all media purchased by Customer and delivered by Vendor. This includes any and all media content purchased directly or supplied as part of training/ support materials.
