Caption types

Synchronized captions – appear onscreen as words are spoken or sounds are made





Synchronized to appear at the same time as the audio is heard
Verbatim, or as close as possible
Equivalent and equal in content



Transcript – is a separate text document that contains the audio information

Audio Description

Audio Description is an audio-only track

Synchronous with the video

Describes necessary visual content

Usually delivered during pauses in dialogue



Be consistent in use of names, character references, location descriptions, etc.

Describe any obvious emotional states but do not interpret them. Preference is to describe facial gesture rather than guess at emotion.

When possible, use vocal style that is compatible with programming
